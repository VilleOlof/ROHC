# ROHC
ROHC (Random One Hour Challenge) Is a Software That Randomizes Custom Levels In MIU And You Get One Hour To Complete As Many As Possible.  

Made By VilleOlof & Contribued By TalentedPlatinum (Most Notably ByteStream & Proper Log Reading)    

This Program Keeps Track Of All The Medals You've Obtained And Reports It At The End.

You Can Enable TTS in the config.txt File If You Prefer, It Will Read Out New Diamond Times, 
Completions & Time Left At Some Intervals And Times Up

There's Two Skip Modes (3 Skips Only & Only Skip If Gold Medal Is Aquired)
Gold Medal Skip Mode Is Enabled By Default (Can Change in config.txt on line 3)

The Program (As You Might Have Noticed) Auto Launched A UI For You
(Can Be Disabled On Line 4 in config.txt)

The Program Generates A Random Seed If Line 5 In config.txt is 'false'
If You Change This To Anything Else That Will Be The Random Seed

You Can Change The UI (LogOutputDisplay.exe) Configs in layoutconfig.txt
Line 1 Is How Far From The Left The Window Should Be  
Line 2 Is How Far From The Top The Window Should Be  
Line 3 Is The Amount Of Time It Should Take For The Overlay To Update (Default 1500)  

Important: If Your Steam Directory Is Not The Default Path in 'Program Files (x86)\Steam',
Change The Path in 'config.txt' To Suit Your Installation Path.
